# Developing an extension

The development of an extension follows a number of stages.

- **Someone starts a discussion via the [standard issue tracker](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues) describing the additional data they want to publish.** It is helpful when the initial post provides examples of the data.

- **Community members with similar data publishing needs are encouraged to discuss a potential data model**. This may involve identifying the sections or building blocks of OCDS that need to be extended to capture this additional data.

- **A draft data model is proposed**. Usually through a mock-up example of some JSON.

- **A schema patch and README file is developed** and [added to the extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/implementation-and-extensions). The JSON patch can be applied to the main schema in order to create an updated OCDS schema for validating extended data. The README file explains the purpose of the extension, the design choices made, and gives an example.

- **A documentation page is created** and made available here, allowing publishers and users to discover the available extensions.
