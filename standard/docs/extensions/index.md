# Extensions

OCDS aims to provide a common core of [sections and building blocks](../../../getting_started/building_blocks.md) for describing contracting processes. 

Many publishers will have additional data that they could publish. Instead of ignoring this data and leaving it unpublished, OCDS encourages publishers to collaborate on the creation of **extensions** to the standard. 

Some extensions with wide adoption may be considered for inclusion as part of the core standard in future versions. Others may be maintained independently by particular communities that need to align the publication of particular additional information.
