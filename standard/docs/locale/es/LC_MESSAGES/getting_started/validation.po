"**Validation** involves a technical check on the way data is structured "
"and formatted. If data is not valid JSON, and does not comply with the "
"OCDS schema, then it cannot be processed by OCDS tools, and will not be "
"interoperable with other data. Providing valid data is an important "
"foundation for interoperable open data."

"**Conformance** involves a detailed check on whether OCDS terms are being"
" used correctly. For example, are you following the field definitions and"
" guidance when entering data, and mapping to the OCDS structure. "
"Conformance involves a human check on how fields are being used, and "
"which extensions to the schema you are using."

"**Completeness** involves checking which sections and building blocks of "

"names."

"**Utility** involves checking whether the data is fit for purpose. This "
